This report accompanies the cross‑coupled spline flow implementation on the sphere.

The earlier one‑layer model could only reweight the longitude and latitude
independently, so it failed to capture multimodal behaviour along the equator.
In contrast, the new architecture introduces conditional transformations:
the slopes of the longitude spline depend on the latitude and vice versa.
By stacking two such layers, the flow is able to model multiple peaks along
the equator, as seen in the heatmap of the learned density.  The
conditional shifts and slopes remain simple linear functions of the
coordinates, which keeps the parameter count manageable and allows the
model to be trained with SciPy's optimisation routines.  A sphere
correction term (\log(\sin\theta)) is still subtracted to account for
the area element on S².  Overall, this cross‑coupled design demonstrates
how even modest coupling between angular directions dramatically improves
the flexibility of normalising flows on non‑Euclidean spaces.
