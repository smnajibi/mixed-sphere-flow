On the sphere the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates have distinct geometries.
Longitude (ϕ) wraps around, so its density must be periodic.  A flow that ignores this
periodicity can accumulate probability mass at an arbitrary branch cut and miss the fact
that ϕ=−π and ϕ=π represent the same physical direction.  By introducing a circular shift
and a periodic spline we ensure that the transformation acts on a circle rather than a
line segment.  Conversely, the latitude (θ̃) lies on a bounded interval and has no
intrinsic wrap‑around.  Using a bounded monotonic spline allows the model to flexibly
reshape the distribution within the allowed range without introducing artificial
periodicity.  The resulting mixed flow therefore respects the topology of S²: one
direction is treated as circular and the other as a finite segment.
